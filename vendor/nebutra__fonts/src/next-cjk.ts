/**
 * @nebutra/fonts/next/cjk — the self-hosted brand faces (server-only).
 *
 * The Latin brand face lives here through `next/font/local` so first-party apps work
 * offline, in CI and in the network sandbox (the registry in `./next` is local too):
 *
 *  - MiSans — the Simplified-Chinese face — is CDN-hosted; see <CjkFontFace /> below.
 *  - DM Sans — the Latin display/heading face (SIL OFL). Chosen the same day
 *    from the same measurement (DeepSeek, Databricks). Body/UI Latin stays
 *    Geist: its tabular figures are what dense dashboard tables need.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE ENTRY FROM `./next`: that module declares 19
 * faces for the theme / DESIGN.md registry; importing it for the brand faces
 * would put all of them into every app's CSS. `./next`
 * re-exports this file, so an app already applying `fontRegistryClassName`
 * still needs one import.
 *
 * next/font is a compile-time transform: SWC statically analyses the call, so
 * the options object is spelled out as a literal.
