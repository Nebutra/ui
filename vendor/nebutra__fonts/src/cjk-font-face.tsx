/**
 * MiSans @font-face, rendered at request time rather than shipped as CSS.
 *
 * The MiSans licence forbids distributing the font on its own and this
 * repository is public, so the subsets live in the deployment's public asset
 * bucket and only their keys are committed (../generated/index.ts). A static
 * stylesheet would have to spell out a host, and the host differs per
 * deployment: Nebutra's CDN for Nebutra, the scaffold's own for a template
 * user. publicAssetUrl() resolves it the way it resolves every other public
 * asset — NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL, then R2_PUBLIC_URL, then the brand's cdn
 * origin.
 *
 * Before the subsets have been uploaded (a fresh scaffold, `pnpm subset:cjk
 * --upload` not yet run) the requests 404 and the token stacks fall through to
 * PingFang / YaHei. That is the intended degraded state, not an error.
